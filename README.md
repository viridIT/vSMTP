# What is vSMTP ?

vSMTP is a next-gen Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) developed by viridIT teams. You
can follow us on [viridit.com](https://www.viridit.com).

## Why develop a new MTA ?

Whereas optimizing allocated resources is becoming a growing challenge, computer
attacks remain a constant issue. Over 300 billion emails are sent and received
in the world every day. Billions of attachments are processed, analyzed and
delivered, contributing to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. To meet
this challenge, viridIT is developing a new technology of email gateways, also
called vSMTP.

## Why vSMTP is your future SMTP server ?

Because it is secured, faster and greener.

- It is developed in Rust, implying high performance and stability.
- It is modular and highly customizable.
- It includes a complete filtering system.
- It is actively maintained and developed.
