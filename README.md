# What is vSMTP ?

vSMTP is a next-gen *Mail Transfer Agent* (MTA), faster, safer and greener.

- It is 100% built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
- It is Lighting fast.
- It is Modular and highly customizable.

## Faster, Safer, Greener

While optimizing IT resources becomes an increasing challenge, computer attacks remain a constant problem.

Every day, over 300 billion emails are sent and received in the world. Billions
of attachments are processed, analyzed and delivered, contributing to the increase
in greenhouse gas emissions.

To meet these challenges, viridIT is developing a new technology of email gateways, also called vSMTP.
