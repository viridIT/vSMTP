# How to track and report security issues

The viridIT team welcomes security reports and is committed to providing prompt
attention to security issues.

## Report a security issue

Please report a security issue by email to
[security@viridit.com](mailto:security@tokio.rs) and include the word "SECURITY"
in the subject line. Security issues should not be reported via the public
Github Issue tracker or via the vSMTP community forum.

## Remediation process

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized by viridIT team. The
project team coordinates remediation with third-party project stakeholders via
[Github Security Advisories](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories).
Third-party stakeholders may include the reporter of the issue, affected direct
or indirect users of vSMTP, and maintainers of upstream dependencies if
applicable.

## Security advisories

The project team is committed to transparency in the security issue disclosure
process. The vSMTP team announces security issues via
[project Github Release notes](https://github.com/viridIT/vSMTP/releases) and
via the [vSMTP community forum](https://viridit.com/community-forum/).
