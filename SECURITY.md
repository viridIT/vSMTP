## Report a security issue

The viridIT team welcomes security reports and is committed to providing prompt attention to security issues.
Please report a security issue by email to [security@viridit.com](mailto:security@tokio.rs) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.
Security issues should not be reported via the public Github Issue tracker or via the [vSMTP community forum](https://viridit.com/community-forum/).

## Remediation process

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized by viridIT team. The project team coordinates remediation with third-party project stakeholders via [Github Security Advisories](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories). Third-party stakeholders may include the reporter of the issue, affected direct or indirect users of vSMTP, and maintainers of upstream dependencies if applicable.

## Security advisories

The project team is committed to transparency in the security issue disclosure process. The vSMTP team announces security issues via [project Github Release notes](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/releases) and via the [vSMTP community forum](https://viridit.com/community-forum/).
